  Procedure: finalizeSale
  Inputs: transaction_number
  Description: Procedure that finalizes a sale given by its transaction number. 
	       The procedure charges customerâ€™s account the total cost of the sale, 
	       reduces qoh of the sold items (carries table) and removes the corresponding 
	       entries from tables transact, debit and sale. Uses a view in order to calculate 
               the total cost of the sale (as suggested) and finally, in case of NULL transaction
	       account, the sale is aborted and an exception is thrown.

  MySQL Version: 5.6.23
